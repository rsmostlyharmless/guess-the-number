# guess-the-number

Adjusted the Guess My Number game on Jonas's Udemy JS course.

During the making of this game I thought I would make my own adjustments to gain understanding of how the js works.

Changes made:

-   Background color will now change to red when the player loses the game.
-   Skull and crossbones image will appear in the guess number box when the player loses.
-   Score counter added that adds in the remainder score then passes the number to the highscore. Highscore will only change when a larger number is achieved in the counter.
